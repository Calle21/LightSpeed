<h3>Chapter 3 - Names</h3>
<p>These are the types of names, or symbols, that exist in Nova</p>
<ul>
<div><b>Function names</b><br />
        <p>Function names consist of a string of lower case letters and numbers, where at least one character is a letter. A program to test whether a string is a legal function name could look like this</p>
<tt><pre class="code">
Bool testname String s
  all (lower || number) s
  where
  Bool lower Char c = c >= 'a & c <= 'z
  Bool number Char c = c >= '0 & c <= '9
        </pre></tt></div>
<p><b>Type variables</b><br>
Type variables consist of only upper case letters.</p>
<p><b>Infix function names</b>
Functions can be infix operators. These names consist of either the special symbols
+ - *
or a normal function name surrounded by back-quotes
`infix`</p>
</ul>
