                <h3>Types</h3>
                <p>Nova has a very rich type-system, similar to the type-system of Haskell. Types are defined with the <i>type</i> keyword, although some short-cuts exist to easier define certain types of types.</p>
                <pre>
                type Set LEAF = (Set LEAF left, LEAF leaf, Set LEAF right)
                struct Ball
                    Int radius
                    Color color
                union Num = Int, Float
                Synonym Color = Int
                </pre>
                <p>Here we see an example of a type variable. LEAF. Type variables can be any type. The Set is a tuple of three, as most sets.</p>
                <p>All types can be defined with the <i>type</i> keyword. The other definitions could be defined like this</p>
                <pre>
                type Ball = (Int radius, Color color)
                type Num = Int | Float
                type Color = Int
                </pre>
                <p>In Nova you can also define types with a predicate. Any value fulfilling the predicate will be of that type. Values are tested at compile time if possible. Otherwise a runtime test will be performed instead. These types are defined like this</p>
                <pre>
                type even Int a
                  a % 2 == 0
                type odd Int a
                  a % 2 == 1
                </pre>
                <p>Now, we have two functions named <i>even</i> and <i>odd</i>, and additionally, we have the types <i>Even</i> and <i>Odd</i> that uses these functions.</p>
