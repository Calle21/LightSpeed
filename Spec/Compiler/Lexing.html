                <p>Lexing is the first step of compilation. The lexer will take a source file of nova-code and create a list of tokens, where each token is accompanied by a line and column number, signifying where the token started.</p>
                <p>There are two fundamental classes of tokens</p>
                <ol>
                        <div>Punctuation</div>
                        <div>All other tokens</div>
                </ol>
                <p>Except for punctuation marks, all tokens must be separated by either whitespace, or punctuation. This is so in order to enforce clean code. I've noticed that modern IDEs separate many expressions by default.</p>
                <p>Punctuation marks are called punctuation because they appear only one at a time. If you seea punctuation mark, that single character always represents the entire token. These are the punctuation marks in Nova</p>
                <p>( ) , [ ] { } # @</p>
                <p>All other tokens are made up of special characters, digits, lower and upper case letters, and also the dot (.) and the quotes (' and "). These are the legal special characters in Nova</p>
                <p>+ - * / & % | \ $ ! < > ^ ~</p>
                <p>Whitespace btw, is only made up of newlines and spaces. That is, tabs are not allowed. This is necessary to maintain the strict indenting rules of Nova.</p>
                <p>The dot in Nova has a special role. It can either be the accessor operator. For example ball.width would access the 'width' field of the struct 'ball' (a struct simply being a tuple whose fields have names). The dot can also be the decimal comma. That is, it is used to create floats, for example 44.234. Because of its' entangled nature it is not treated as a punctuation mark, and for cleanliness sake it is not allowed as a special character.</p>
                <p>Much the same can be said of the double quote ("), which is used to denote string literals, and the single quote ('), which is used to denote character literals</p>
                <p>Ratios in Nova btw is created with the '/'. For example, 33/12 would be a ratio of 33 12:ths.</p>
                <p>Besides punctuation, these are the types of tokens that exists</p>
                <h4>Integers [0-9]+</h4>
                <p>Made up of just digits</p>
                <h4>Floats [0-9]+\.[0-9]+</h4>
                <p>Two integers separated by a dot</p>
                <h4>Type variables [A-Z]+</h4>
                <p>Made up of just upper case letters</p>
                <h4>Function names [a-z0-9]+</h4>
                <p>Made up of lower case and numbers. These are used as function names.</p>
                <h4>Types [A-Z][A-Za-Z0-9]*</h4>
                <p>Must start with an upper case letter</p>
                <h4>Character literals '(.|[0-9]{3})</h4>
                <p>Character literals are started with the single quote, followed by the character itself. Some characters may be more conveniently written with their ascii code. That is, the single quote would just be followed by three digits (decimal). Shortcuts also exist for tab, newline, space and null. These would be written as 'tab 'newline 'space and 'nul. These shortcuts are not case-sensitive</p>
                <h4>String literals "*"</h4>
                <p>String literals are written as in many other languages. Simply just a string of characters enclosed by double quotes. Within the string there may be escape characters. Escape characters are begun with the back-slash (\) and followed either by 'n', for newline, '\' for the backslash itself, 't' for tab, '0' for nul, '"' for double quote or two hex-chars ([a-fA-F0-9]) to denote any ascii character</p>
                <p>Additionally there are comments. These are just ignored and not made into tokens. Single line comments are begun with two back-slashes (\\). So, any valid token made up of two back-slashes will begin a single line comment.</p>
                <p>Multi-line comments are possible. These are begun with a line consisting of a single space, followed by five or more hashes (#). No more or less. The multiline comment is also terminated by a line of the same syntax</p>
