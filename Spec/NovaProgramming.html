                <p>This document is a specification for the Nova programming language. It consists of three parts. The first part is a tutorial on the language. The second part is a complete definition of the standard library, written in Nova (what else?), along with explanations. The third part is a description of the compiler, starting at the top with lexing all the way down to machine code generation. If any detail about the language is not covered in one part, it is surely covered in another</p>
                <p>Nova is a hobby project. I am not a professional programmer at the moment. Work on the compiler has begun, but is probably not going to be finished anywhere soon.</p>
