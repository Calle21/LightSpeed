                <p>Indentation plays a big role in Nova. Instead of using semi-colons and brackets, Nova uses newlines and indentation to figure out the structure of a program.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking, a new block of code will be indented with two spaces relative to the surrounding code. Statements that follow eachother in the same block of code must have the same level of indentation.</p>
