                <p>The basics on variables has already been covered. However, there is more about them still.</p>
                <pre>
                myfunction Int a
                  (a,b) = (a * 2
                           a * 3)
                  (b,a)
                </pre>
                <p>So, what's this about? A tuple on the left hand side of the equals sign?</p>
                <p>This does not mean that we create a tuple. The tuple syntax is simply just used to tell the compiler that we're defining two variables in one swoop. What this means is that neither variable will be referable until both has been defined. You can put as many variables as you wish in such a tuple.</p>
                <p>In this case it is necessary because we named one of the variables the same as the argument. If we had lined them up like we do normally then the variable 'a' would have shadowed the parameter (which technically also is a variable), and the variable 'b' would have been different.</p>
                <h3>Reuse of variable space</h3>
                <p>When a shadowing does occur, as above, the compiler is forced to figure out whether the old variable is still needed, or refered to, anywhere. If it isn't, the new variable will, if possible, reuse the memory allocated for the old variable. This makes the language work similarly to imperative languages, where variables are mutable.</p>
                <p>So, to wrap up. The 'a' variable in our case will actually replace the 'a' parameter in memory.</p>
                <h3>Shadowing</h3>
                <p>Each library that you use is its' own namespace, and can be reached with the <i>library name</i>::<i>variable name</i> syntax. However, all libraries that a project uses will be merged into the standard namespace. This namespace contains all values. That is, functions do not have their own namespace. There are no "forbidden" variable names, except for reserved keywords, so any variable can shadow any other.</p>
