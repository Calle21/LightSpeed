                <p>Arrays can be multi-dimensional in Nova. The dimension however, are simply just symbolized by a simple integer. The actual length of the dimensions are only know a runtime. That is, it is not part of the type identifier. This is due to simplicity. To illustrate</p>
                <pre>
                Int getanelem Array 2 Int a
                  a ! (2,2)
                </pre>
                <p>This function would extract an element with the indices (2,2) from a two-dimensional array. If this is out of bounds, then a runtime error is thrown.</p>
