                <p>The standard library defines a type suitable for extracting sub-sequences. The <i>Sequence</i> type. This is how it is defined.</p>
                <pre>
                type Sequence E = (Array E, Int, Int)
                </pre>
                <p>A Sequence is simply a tuple. One element is an array of any type, and the other two a start and an end index. The reason it is suitable for extracting subsequences is that you don't have to copy the array itself. You just create a new tuple, use the same array but change the start and end index.</p>
