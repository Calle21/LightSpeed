                <p>Nova is similar in appearance to many imperative languages. However, it is a purely functional language. What this means is that structures and variables are immutable. There are short-cuts around this to make the code more efficient, and even some unsafe cheats to be used in special exceptional cases, however, for safety, clarity and convenience sake, everything is immutable by default.</p>
