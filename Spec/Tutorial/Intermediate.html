                <p>In Nova it is possible to write "inline assembler" using a predefined intermediate code very similar to any assembler language. In fact, it is an assembler language with somewhat sophisticated features. A modern assembler language if you will. The language of choice is the Saga language. which is another hobby project by me.</p>
                <p>The reason that inline assembler is enabled in the Nova language is to write really fast computations. Also, the basic operators like +, - etc can now be defined with the language itself. The high-level code though should compile really fast anyway, and basic operators could easily be implemented in other ways, so maybe the main reason that the intermediate keyword exists is just for plain fun...</p>
