                <p>To create a project in Nova, you first create a folder. The name of this folder will automatically be the name of the project. The naming rules are the same as for types. That is, the project name must start with an upper case letter, followed by any combination of lower-case, upper-case and digits.</p>
                <p>Within the folder there may be sub-folders, .nova source files and a couple configuration files. The most important configuration file is the "use" file, which tells the compiler which libraries you use. In your first projects, the use-file will probably look like this
                <code>
                        <p>Nova</p>
                </code>
                <p>This tells the compiler that the only library you use is the Nova standard library. If you were to use several libraries, it would look like this
                <code>
                        <p>Nova, OpenGL, OpenAL (all rights reserved)</p>
                        <p>+, -, * << Nova</p>
                </code>
                <p>Now, you're using three libraries, and the (hypothetical) name clashes +, - and * are resolved by telling the compiler that these identifiers are to be used from the Nova library. If you wanted to use an identifier from any specific library you could also just write "OpenAL::+" to say that you wanted to use the + operator from the OpenAL library</p>
                <p>Sub-folders play no specific role in Nova other than to simplify the structure and make life easier for the programmer. All global identifiers are visible to the entire program.</p>
                <p>Nova source files are named quite specifically. That is, if you have a function called "helloworld", which takes exactly one parameter, let's say a name, then the source file would have to be named, exactly, "helloworld_.nova". The underscore symbolizes a parameter. In order to overload functions, you have to put them in the same source file. More on overloading later.</p>
