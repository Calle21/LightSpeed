                <p>In Nova all variables are immutable. Variables are created with the equals sign.</p>
                <pre>
                Int myfunction Int a
                  b = a * 2
                  c = b * 2
                  c * 2
                </pre>
                <p>Here we have a function that will multiply its' argument with eight.</p>
                <p>Within a block of equations, each preceding variable is referable in later definitions. However, a variable is not referable <i>before</i> it has be defined.</p>
