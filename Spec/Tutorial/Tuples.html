                <p>Tuples are like structures. In fact, they are structures. Sometimes the elements of the tuple may have names, and then we call it a struct, sometimes they don't. Sometime a tuple is refered to by a name, sometimes not. In memory a tuple is simply a pointer to a place in memory where several elements reside. To demonstrate</p>
                <pre>
                createsometuples Int a
                  t0 = (a, a + 1, a + 2)
                  t1 = (a, a - 1, a - 2)
                  t2 = (a, a * 2, a * 3)
                  (t0,t1,t2)
                </pre>
                <p>Ok, so from one integer we created no less than four tuples. The types of the 'tx' variables are all the same. It is '(Int,Int,Int)'. And the return type of our function is '((Int,Int,Int),(Int,Int,Int),(Int,Int,Int))' (phew). However, we do not need to write this out, fortunately, because the compiler will automatically derive the types of all thos values.</p>
                <p>In memory a tuple is always a pointer. The actual elements may be allocated on the stack, if an optimization has been made, or on the heap.</p>
