dot notation is used in nova to access struct fields. However, it can be used for a lot more than that

a.b

this expression would parse as

(b a)

that is, apply 'a' to 'b'. This may seem like a very simple parsing trick, but it is very useful.

plane.increaseSpeed

would become

(increaseSpeed plane)

and

(plane0,plane1).collide

would become

(collide (plane0,plane1))

So, with a very simple maneuver Nova implements the feel of object-oriented languages.
