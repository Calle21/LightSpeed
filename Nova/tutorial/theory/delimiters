There are three delimiters in Nova. (), [] and {}

() is used to create tuples

[] is used to create arrays

{} is used to create lists

(a,b) creates a tuple containing 'a' and 'b'

[1,2,3] creates a one-dimensional array with the elements '1', '2' and '3'

{1,2,3} creates a lsit with the elements '1', '2' and '3'

There are two ways to write tuples. Comma-form and newline-form. The three examples above are written in comma-form. If they were written in newline-form they would look like this

(a
 b)

[1
 2
 3]

{1
 2
 3}

The elements have to line up on the same column when writing in newline-form. Newline at the begining or the end is allowed
     (
   a
   b
   c
      )

  [
      1
      2
      3
  ]

    { 1
      2
      3
 }

These are all valid delimiters. When writing in comma-form, newline is also permitted. 

  (a , b , c
       , d , e , f)

  [
   a , b , c ,
      d , e , f
  ]

  { a , b , c
, d , e , f
   }

are also valid delimiters

Delimiters are also used when writing types. () is used for tuples, [] for array and {} for lists. Just like when writing expressions

(A,B) a tuple with the types 'A' and 'B'

[Int] an array containing 'Int'

{{Char}} a list containing lists of 'Char'

Newline and comma-form work the same way as with expressions when writing tuples

 (A,B
  ,C,D)

(A
 B)

are both valid tuple-types
