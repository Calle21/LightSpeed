There are typeclasses in Nova. They are not the same as Haskell's typeclasses however. They are an important concept to understand.

Typeclasses really only matter to the memory-management algorithms. Objects of the same typeclass will be treated identically by the memory-management algorithms, but differently by the compiler. Here are some examples of different type-classes

Int
Table Int
(Int,Int)
(Table Int,Int)

New members of a type-class can be created with the 'type' keyword

type Float = Int

type Char = Int

These two are defined in the Nova standard library. This means that 'Float' and 'Char' are not typeclasses them-selves, but members of the 'Int' typeclass
